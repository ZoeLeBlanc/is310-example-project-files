## Conclusion & Reflection

- In this section, I would detail any big picture takeaways about what I learned from this project and how it has helped me to understand working with cultural data and computing in the humanities, and then specifically what this project has found over how the development of technology over time shaped discourses on the Humanist Listserv.
- I would also reflect and summarize any challenges I faced in completing this project and how I overcame them, as well as any future directions I might take this project.
- Finally, I would also include any guidance for others who might want to utilize this data or methods in their own research, and how they might go about doing so.
